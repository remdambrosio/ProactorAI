# ProactorAI
Anonymized public version of a network monitoring tool, developed for the BC Government (CITZ).
Built by me, Sofiia Khutorna, and Tariq Chatur in 2024.

Some key elements have been omitted or anonymized for network security reasons, so none of this will run. We also had to build some API wrappers, which are not included. If you're reading this, please excuse the mess!
